# SPA-routing-experience
Improving client-side routing in single-page apps (SPAs) through good UX

## A better accessible router and skip link
It's important to include a skip link for keyboard navigation. It's important to let screen readers know a route was changed client-side. These are fairly simple tasks in isolation, but become more nuanced when you try to do both well, together. This is our attempt at doing just that.

## Getting started
This repo requires you to type a few commands into a terminal window. Commands are shown in code blocks that begin with a dollar sign like this `$ command to type`. You can retype these commands or copy and paste them into your terminal window. Do not include the dollar sign ` $ ` when you type or copy commands into your terminal.

1. Confirm you have NodeJS installed. Open a terminal and type `$ node --version`
1. You should see output like **v16.14.2**. If not, [download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install it on your local machine.
1. Clone this repo. If you&rsquo;ve never cloned a repo, GitHub has [great instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
1. Then type the following commands, one at a time:
1. `$ cd /location/to/SPA-routing-experience/` to change directories
1. `$ npm install` to install libraries and dependencies
1. `$ npm run start` to start a development server
1. The application will compile and be available at `localhost:3000` in the browser of your choice
